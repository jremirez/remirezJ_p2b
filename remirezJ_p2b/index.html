        <h2>ABOUT THIS REPORT</h2>
        <p>This year, Kellogg moved to a new reporting format, a PDF Executive Summary and a Corporate Responsibility website. In lieu of a 50-page PDF, this Executive Summary provides a high-level overview of our commitments. The Corporate Responsibility website includes complete information about our initiatives and progress toward our commitments. More data on our progress across specific topics like responsible sourcing, human rights and employee safety can be found on our Positions, Policies, Milestones and Reporting page. The information we share primarily covers our 2019 activities. We’ve also included a few examples of our corporate responsibility efforts from late 2018 and early 2020.<br><br>We continue to use the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and its Food Processing Sector Standards, plus the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Processed Foods Standards. We are reporting in accordance with GRI’s “Core” option and have also included additional information addressing some “Comprehensive” reporting disclosures. This information is available on our website.<br><br>Kellogg Company’s most recent full GRI-based Corporate Responsibility Report was published in 2019. We intend to continue publishing an annual Corporate Responsibility Report, as well as GRI and SASB indices. We welcome questions and feedback at https://www.kelloggs.com/en_US/ contact-us.html.</p>

        <h2>MESSAGE FROM THE CEO</h2>
        <p><strong>Kellogg is a company with Heart and Soul.</strong><br><br>Our founder, W.K. Kellogg, was a man far ahead of his time. Long before sustainability and corporate purpose were part of the mainstream, he cared about leaving the world a better place than he found it. Health and wellbeing mattered to him; so did caring for communities. Because of our visionary founder, these are the values we continue to demonstrate every day. We call it our Heart and Soul, and it’s never been more apparent as our company and employees support each other and our neighbors during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic as well as the broader climate of racial discrimination and intolerance.<br><br><strong>The health and safety of our employees is always our top priority.</strong><br><br>We are pulling out all the stops to ensure they are supported during these challenging times. In addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, people who can work from home are doing so. For those on the front-lines in stores or producing foods to help meet the unprecedented needs around the world, we’ve significantly enhanced our already robust sanitation protocols, and implemented strict social distancing and wellness checks. We also have enhanced benefits for front-line employees including extended ill time, “thank-you” bonuses and child-care alternatives, so they can care for themselves and their families.</p>

        <h2>WE'VE EXPANDED OUR WORKFORCE</h2>
        <p>Some places due to increased demand and to ensure our hard- working employees have time to rest and recharge. Of course, these steps are above and beyond what we do every day to put our people first.
        New research from the United Nations University1 predicts that the fallout from the COVID-19 could push half a billion people into poverty in developing countries, which would significantly increase their risk of food insecurity.<br><br>As of June 2020, Kellogg Company and its charitable funds have donated more than $13 million in food and funds to global COVID-19 hunger relief efforts, to ensure families and children continue to receive critical nourishment. Kellogg is providing additional support to our food bank partners in every region2, helping those who may not know where their next meal is coming from. You can learn more about our global COVID-19 hunger relief efforts that are part of Kellogg’s® Better Days global purpose platform here.</p>

        <p>As a company, we continue to strive to create an environment where individuals of all races, genders, backgrounds, sexual orientation, religions, capabilities and beliefs are treated with dignity and respect; there is no tolerance for discrimination; and we courageously speak up when we observe actions and behaviors that are not consistent with our values. We are taking actions internally including but not limited to increased training, hosting conversations and promoting connectedness among our employees and communities to help build a more just world.<br><br>In addition, Kellogg Company and our Kellogg Company Fund are committing an additional $1 million to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to support the important work they are doing to create a society in which individuals have equal rights without racial discrimination. Kellogg is a long-standing partner and funder of the NAACP.

        <p>As a leading plant-based foods company, Kellogg and our people are helping to address issues facing society today. In addition to focusing on COVID-19 and racial discrimination, we’re also developing foods to deliver holistic wellbeing to people everywhere, in an accessible way. We’re providing food for people, especially children, facing hunger. We’re supporting farmers and responsibly growing our ingredients. We’re minimizing the impact of our operations on the environment. We’re reducing waste and creating packaging that’s reusable, recyclable or compostable. And we’re protecting human rights all along our value chain.<br><br>Since 2015, Kellogg has created Better Days for nearly 600 million people worldwide. We’ve done so by donating 2.4 billion servings of food to people facing hunger, reaching 3.2 million children through feeding programs, supporting more than 433,000 farmers with climate-smart agriculture programs that support biodiversity, and by reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the equivalent of taking nearly 2.5 billion vehicle miles off the road3,4.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <p>We’re humbled that, as a result of these and other efforts, Kellogg has been recognized with some of the highest honors including from the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, FTSE4Good, the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark, Ethisphere’s World’s Most Ethical Companies, the MSCI ESG Leaders and ECPI Group indices of companies with highly regarded environmental, social and governance commitments.<br><br>We live at a time when there’s a lot of anxiety, especially among those poised to inherit our world. They’re understandably concerned about where we’re going. And they wonder if we are doing enough. We at Kellogg share that concern and are committed to continuing our founder’s legacy by doing everything we can to leave the world a better place than we found it.</p>

        <p>Nurture people and our planet by supporting 1 million farmers and workers while conserving natural resources across our value chain by meeting our science-based targets, responsibly sourcing our ingredients, reducing organic waste and providing sustainable packaging.<br><br>Kellogg has helped more than 433,000 farmers adopt sustainable agriculture practices that support biodiversity and improve climate resiliency. Our company, which already has one of the smallest plastic packaging footprints among peer food companies7, achieved 76% packaging recyclability globally in 2019. We also reduced greenhouse gas emissions in our manufacturing sites by more than 20% – exceeding our 15% reduction goal one year ahead of schedule.</p>

        <h2>INTEGRATING OUR COMMITMENTS FOR MORE COMPREHENSIVE OUTCOMES</h2>
        <p>Helping to address food security has long been our priority. So, while our efforts in the areas of wellbeing, hunger relief and climate resiliency are not new, our Kellogg’s® Better Days commitments are the first time we have fully integrated this work to further embed purpose into our company in alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals’ (SDG) 2030 target. We’re passionate about working with others during the next 10 years to help achieve the United Nations’ vision of “peace and prosperity for people and the planet.”<br><br>This Executive Summary of our 2019/2020 Corporate Responsibility progress provides many examples of the Kellogg’s® Better Days work already underway. We’ll provide first-year progress against our metrics in our 2020/2021 Executive Summary. Finally, we are grateful to our employees, share- owners, customers, people who enjoy our foods, suppliers, government leaders, nongovernmental organizations and partners for their support as we work together to drive positive change for 3 billion people worldwide.</p>
